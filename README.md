# Qualtrics-get-Survey-Data
This java code gets the survey responses from the Qualtrics survey. The code is written using the Qualtrics Rest API
documentation. The API token in this code has been removed so that the user cannot manipulate the survey. 

The code can be reused by anyone who wants to create a survey on Qualtrics and get the responses in a csv format. Just 
include the API token of your survey in the placeholder of #####, and change the survey ID (Towards the end of the stringUrl).
